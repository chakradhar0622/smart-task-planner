**SMART TASK PLANNER**

An AI-powered smart goal planner that helps users transform their goals into actionable task plans with timelines and dependencies.
Built using React + TypeScript + Vite, styled with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui, and powered by an AI backend (e.g., Gemini API / OpenAI).


**Installation & Setup**

Clone the repository: 

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-task-planner.git
cd smart-task-planner

Install dependencies
npm install


Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add:

VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_or_openai_api_key

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  # or your backend endpoint


Run the development server
npm run dev


Then open your browser and visit:
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:5173


**How It Works**


The user enters a goal in the input form.
The system sends it to an AI backend (e.g., Gemini or OpenAI) via API.
The AI returns a structured breakdown with tasks, durations, and dependencies.
The frontend renders each task as an interactive card with timeline details.
